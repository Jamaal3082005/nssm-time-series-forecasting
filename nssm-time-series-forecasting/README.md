# Time Series Forecasting with Neural State Space Models (NSSMs)

This repository contains a complete implementation of a Neural State Space Model (NSSM) for high-frequency time series forecasting, along with a baseline LSTM comparison.

Please refer to the project report submitted on the Cultus platform for full methodology, results, and analysis.
